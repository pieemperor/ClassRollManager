# Class Roll Manager

This repository includes the 1st, 3rd, and 4th projects I did for my 2nd Intro to Computer Science class. 

In this project, there are 2 driver files. The StudentDriver.Java file uses JOptionPane to interact with the user and 
manage a list of Student objects. The ClassRollDriver file uses the console to interact with the user and manages different
courses. It keeps track of the course information and the students in those courses. In this project, I used enums, arraylists,
and sorting. For my first project in this class, I implemented the Student class and the JOptionPane driver. Then, project 3 
extended the functionality to keep track of classes and the students in those classes. Project 4 extended the functionality 
even further to include saving the data to a file and reading the data from that file.
